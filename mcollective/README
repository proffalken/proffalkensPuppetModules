WARNING - THIS MODULE IS NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE AT PRESENT

This module will allow automated deployment of MCollective via puppet.

It needs various defines created to role out the correct RPMS and a custom repository configured with the correct packages before it will work!

It is just a template at present, more will be added in the next few days.
